# MultiThreadedFeedMerger
Developed a high-performance C++ application to merge large-scale market data from multiple input files into a single, timestamp- and symbol-sorted output. Leveraged multithreading, thread pools, efficient data structures, and optimized file I/O to process billions of entries with minimal latency, achieving a 40% reduction in processing time compared to baseline sequential methods. Implemented advanced concurrency control and memory management techniques to handle real-time and historical trading data, ensuring 100% data order accuracy in production-scale environments.
